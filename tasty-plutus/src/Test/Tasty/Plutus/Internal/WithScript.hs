{- | Provides a monadic API for composing tests against the same validator or
 minting policy. While it has all the capabilities of a monad, you mostly
 won't need them. An example of the intended usage is:

 > withValidator "Testing my validator" myValidator $ do
 >    shouldValidate "Valid case" validData validContext
 >    shouldn'tValidate "Invalid context" validData invalidContext
 >    shouldn'tValidate "Invalid data" invalidData validContext
 >    shouldn'tValidate "Everything is bad" invalidData invalidContext
 >    scriptProperty "Some property" myGenerator mkContext
 >    ...

 'withMintingPolicy' works similarly.
