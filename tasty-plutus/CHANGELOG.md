  input goes.

* Add `Test.Tasty.Plutus.Script.Size`, containing a script size testing
  interface.

## 3.3 -- 2021-10-26

### Added

* `shouldn'tValidateTracing` and `shouldValidateTracing`, giving an explicit
  handle and predicate on traces.

## 3.2 -- 2021-10-19

### Changed

* Minting-related `ContextBuilder` functionality is now polymorphic in its
  `Purpose`.
* Fix a bug where _expected_ script failures reported as test failures in all
  cases, instead of only when unexpected.

## 3.1 -- 2021-10-14

### Added

* Support for QuickCheck-based property testing.
* Multiple new modules.
* Additional `tasty` options to control property-based execution.
* More examples in documentation.
* Dependency on `plutus-pretty`.
* New option for trace logs even on success for the unit-test-like interface.

### Changed

* Multiple definitions moved to own modules from `Unit`. `Unit` still re-exports
  these temporarily for backwards compatibility.
* Only one `Internal` module containing everything that needs hiding.
* `EvaluationError` no longer causes a test abort.

### Deleted

* `Test.Tasty.Plutus.Context.Internal` module (now merged into
  `Test.Tasty.Plutus.Internal`).

## 3.0 -- 2021-10-04

### Added

* `paysLovelaceToPubKey`, `paysLovelaceToWallet`.
* Minting validator support and functions.
* `TestData` type for testing API.
* Multiple `tasty` options.

### Changed

* `tagged` is now `datum` to reflect its more general purpose.
* 'Construction' functions in `Context` are now polymorphic over
  `Purpose`s.
* `InputType` and `OutputType` unified into `ExternalType`.
* Testing API now supports minting, and has been reworked with that in mind.
* Significant modifications to the entire testing API to use Plutus' own CEK
  interpreter.
* `WithValidator` is now `WithScript`.
* `Test.Tasty.Plutus.Validator.Unit` is now `Test.Tasty.Plutus.Script.Unit`.
* Plutus bumped to `58c093a49eb7a369865e361179d649264fc817a4`.

### Removed

* `ForCertifying` and `ForRewarding` constructors of `Purpose`. We have no plans
  to support these.
* `spendsFromSelf`, as self-spending is now handled differently.
* `compile`, as this is now handled purely internally.
* `DecodeFailure`, as this condition no longer exists.
* Dependencies on `validation` and `witherable`.

## 2.0 -- 2021-09-14

### Changed

* Better rendering of record-like things.
* Depend on `pretty-show`.

### Removed
